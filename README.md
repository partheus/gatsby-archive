# partheus.github.io

The simplest site I could make, made mainly with old-school HTML and CSS.

This is a pet side-project that I return to and revamp every time an existential epiphany makes its way into my life.
Like everything else, this is a work in progress. Thanks for visiting.

**Update:** This site is no longer being maintained. [Here's](https://parth-new.netlify.com) the new site I'm working on.
